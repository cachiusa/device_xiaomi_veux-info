## What is Firmware? Is it a full ROM or OTA package?
Firmware is not a ROM nor OTA Package, it's a set of low-level drivers which helps the operating system do whatever it wants to do. It includes various things like Modem, Bluetooth, Bootloader, DSP and etc.

## Why should I update the Firmware?
Firmware is provided from Xiaomi directly, and there are no sources for it to let developers build and edit it on their own like custom ROMs, so if you want to keep your device up to date always update your firmware!

## Do I need updating the Firmware If I'm MIUI official or MIUI custom ROM user?
No, MIUI ROMs contain the firmware-update package which I extract and provide here.

## How to update firmware?
* Download the package you want to flash. IT MUST BE NAMED WITH THE SAME CODENAME OF YOUR DEVICE.

* Flash it using TWRP or any custom recovery. There's no need to wipe/format anything before or after the installation.

## How to check the updated firmware?
Usually, the modem gets updated with newer firmware, you can check it in Settings > About > Baseband.
